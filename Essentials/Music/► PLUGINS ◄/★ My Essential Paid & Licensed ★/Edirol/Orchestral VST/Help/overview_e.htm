<h1>I <a name="Overview">Overview</a></h1>
<p>The High Quality Software Synthesizer &quot;Orchestral &quot; (for simplicity's 
sake, from here on we'll refer to it as &quot;Orchestral&quot;) is a plug-in 
software synthesizer that provides string, wind, percussion, and keyboard instruments 
suitable for classical music and screen music.</p>
<p>It features the same high quality synthesizer engine and effects found on 
all products of this series, and also supports DXi 2/VST2.0 multiple outputs, 
delivering flexibility and quality for your musical productions.</p>
<h2><a name="Main features">Main features</a></h2>
        <h3>High quality orchestral sounds in one package</h3>
<p>Orchestral gives you a string section that even reproduces pizzicato and 
tremolo playing techniques, a concert grand piano rich in ambience, oboe and 
other wind instruments, timpani, harp, and other indispensable, high quality 
orchestral sounds. It is the ideal choice for classical music or screen music 
production.</p>
<dl>
<dl>
        <dt>Strings:
        <dd>Violin, viola, cello, and contrabass sections, with pizzicato and 
        tremolo variations included. Solo sounds for each instrument are also 
        included, as well as harp.<dd>
        &nbsp;<dt>Wind:
        <dd>Brass section, brass instruments such as trumpet and horn, and woodwinds 
        such as flute, oboe, and clarinet are included.<br>&nbsp;
        <dt>Percussion:<dd>Timpani and other orchestral percussion instruments<br>&nbsp;
        <dt>Keyboard instruments:<dd>Piano, harpsichord</dl>
</dl>
        <h3>Hybrid package contains two types of plug-ins</h3>
<p>The package contains two types of plug-ins (supporting DirectX instruments 
(DXi) and VST instruments), for seamless operation with major high-performance 
sequencers, such as Cakewalk SONAR, Home Studio, Music Creator, Plasma, CUBASE, 
and Logic Audio.</p>
<h3>The same high quality synthesizer engine as all products in the series</h3>
<p>The software synthesis engine uses 32-bit floating point processing and supports 
96 kHz for top-notch output quality. Intel Corporation's SSE instructions, AMD 
Corporation's Enhanced 3DNow! technology, and Motorola Corporation's AltiVec 
are supported in order to take maximum advantage of your CPU's high-speed signal 
processing power.</p>
        <h3>Support for multiple outputs</h3>
<p>The multi-channel output capability of DXi 2 and VST 2.0 is supported. In your 
host application, you can apply effects independently to each part, or output 
audio to multiple devices.</p>
<ul>
<p class="note">
<img src="img/sign_attention.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0" alt="sign_attention.gif" align="absmiddle"> 
In order to use multiple outputs, you must have a host application that supports 
    DXi 2 or VST 2.0 multi-out capability.</p>
</ul>
        <h3>Internal effects</h3>
<p>Orchestral provides high quality reverb (three types) that rivals dedicated 
units, as well as chorus/delay. Effect presets optimized for orchestral sounds 
are also provided, delivering the rich ambience of a concert hall.</p>

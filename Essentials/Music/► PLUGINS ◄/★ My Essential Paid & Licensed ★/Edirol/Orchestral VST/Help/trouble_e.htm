<h3>[2] <a name="Sound is interrupted playback tempo is irregula">Sound is interrupted/playback tempo is irregular/playback stops midway 
through </a></h3>
<p>Check the following items.</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>If your host application allows you to adjust the size of the audio 
    buffer, try increasing the buffer size.</li>
</ul>
<p>* Increasing the buffer size will increase the delay (latency) of the sound. 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>If you are using Orchestral on the Macintosh with the Cubase series, 
check the &quot;<b>Favor MIDI Timing</b>&quot; setting found in the <b>General</b> section 
of <b>Audio System Setup</b>.</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>It is possible that playback cannot be performed correctly because other 
    software is placing a processing load on the computer. Please exit any software 
    you are not using. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Refer to the troubleshooting section in the documentation for your host 
    application or audio device. Suggestions on how to solve problems with audio 
    playback may be effective for this situation as well. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Try decreasing the POLYPHONY LIMIT in the <a href="pnl_master_e.htm#Master Panel">Master Panel</a>. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>In the <a href="pnl_master_e.htm#Master Panel">Master Panel</a>, try turning [CHORUS] and/or [REVERB] off. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>In the <a href="pnl_system_e.htm#OPTIONS">Option</a> page of the System 
    Setting screen, try selecting &quot;<b>Light Load Mode</b>.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, however, that if the MIDI data you are attempting to play is of such 
complexity that it requires sound processing capabilities that are well beyond 
those of your computer, these measures may not help.</p>
<p>Such problems can also occur depending on the operating environment of your 
computer (other drivers and software).</p>

</ul>
<h3>[3] <a name="Notes are delayed">Notes are delayed </a></h3>
<p>Check the following points.</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>If your host application allows you to adjust the size of the audio 
    buffer, try decreasing the buffer size.</li>
</ul>
<p>* Decreasing the buffer size too much may cause notes to be interrupted or 
fail to sound. Make this setting as appropriate for the performance of your 
computer and audio device. </p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>If the documentation for your host application or audio device contains 
    suggestions on how to fix problems with delayed notes, follow those suggestions. 
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the performance of your computer, and on the specifications 
of your host application and audio device, it may not be possible to resolve 
this problem.</p>
<h3>[4] <a name="Insufficient polyphony Notes are omitted">Insufficient polyphony/Notes are omitted</a></h3>
<p>It is possible that this is being limited by the maximum polyphony setting. 
Check the LIMIT setting for POLYPHONY in the <a href="pnl_master_e.htm#Master Panel">Master Panel</a>.</p>
<p>* You can check the actual polyphony in the <b>[POLYPHONY]</b> area of the Master 
Panel.</p>
<h3>[5] <a name="Sound is distorted">Sound is distorted </a></h3>
<p>Try lowering the master volume in the <a href="pnl_master_e.htm#Master Panel">Master 
Panel</a>. </p>
<h3>[6] <a name="Effects are not applied">Effects (reverb/chorus/delay) are not applied</a></h3>
<p>Check the following.</p>
<ul>
    <li>In the Effects tab of the Master panel, make sure that effects are turned 
    ON.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Are you using multi-out?<br>If you are using multi-out, parts assigned 
    to an output destination other than <b>OUTPUT 1</b> cannot use Orchestral's 
    built-in effects (reverb/chorus/delay).<br>If you want to use the built-in 
    effects on a part, set the output destination of that part to <b>OUTPUT 
    1</b>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>[7] <a name="Effects are not applied to the rhythm part">Effects (reverb/chorus/delay) are not applied to the rhythm part </a></h3>
<p>For the rhythm part, the effect send amount (send level) is set individually 
for each rhythm instrument.</p>
<p>Even if the send level of the rhythm part is specified from the Part Editor 
window, or from within the music data, there will be no effect if the send level 
of each instrument is turned down.</p>
<p>Make sure that the music data also specifies the send level of each instrument 
to which you want to apply the effect. </p>
<p>* For details on effect send level settings for rhythm instruments, refer to 
&quot;<a href="pnl_rhythm_e.htm#Rhythm Part Editor">Rhythm Part Editor.</a>&quot;</p>
<h3>[8] <a name="Failure to plug-in">Failure to plug-in </a></h3>
<p>Check the following points.</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Orchestral can be used only with the following audio formats. Check 
    the audio format of your host application. <br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul type="disc">
    <li>It is possible that your computer does not have enough memory. Try exiting 
    any other applications that you are not using. If failure to plug-in occurs 
    frequently due to insufficient memory, we recommend that you install additional 
    memory in your computer. </li>
</ul>
<h3>[9] <a name="System exclusive messages cannot be received">System exclusive messages cannot be received </a></h3>
<p>If you are using the VST instrument version, system exclusive messages cannot 
be received due to the VST instrument specification. </p>
<h3>[10] <a name="An error of Can't allocate Memory is displayed when you plug-in" Can't allocate Memory" is displaye">An error of &quot;Can't allocate Memory&quot; is displayed when you 
plug-in (Macintosh) </a></h3>
<p>This error occurs if there is not enough memory to start up the plug-in. 
Please increase the memory that is allocated to the application. </p>
<h3>[11] <a name="VST instruments do not receive control change m">VST instruments do not receive control change messages </a></h3>
<p>If you are using Emagic's &quot;Logic&quot; series as the host application, 
some control change messages cannot be received by VST instruments, due to the 
specifications of the Logic series. (For the current specifications of Logic, 
refer to the documentation of the Logic series.) </p>
<p>In this case, you can either directly operate the knobs and sliders in Orchestral's 
windows, or assign the desired parameter to a different control change.</p>
<p>For details on control change assignments, refer to &quot;<a href="cc_asign_e.htm#Control change assignments">Control change 
assignments</a>.&quot;</p>
<h3>[12] <a name="Can't use Save Bank Load Bank of VST instrument">Can't use Save Bank/Load Bank of VST instruments to save/load settings 
</a></h3>
<p>It is not possible to use the &quot;Save Bank&quot; and &quot;Load Bank&quot; 
commands for VST instruments of your host application to save Orchestral&nbsp;settings. 
</p>
<p>Orchestral settings must be saved/loaded as performance data. For details 
on saving/loading performance data, refer to &quot;<a href="performance_e.htm#Saving and loading performance data">Saving and loading performance data</a>.&quot; 
</p>
<h3>[13] <a name="When the Orchestral's panel is operated, a diff">When the Orchestral's panel is operated, a different slider or the sound 
    of another sound module also changes.</a></h3>
<p>Is automation enabled?</p>
<p>If automation is enabled, operating the Orchestral's&nbsp;panel will send 
MIDI messages that assigned to parameter&nbsp;to the host application.</p>
<p>These MIDI messages may cause unintended parameters to change at the same 
time.</p>
<p>If this occurs, try unchecking &quot;<b>Record Panel operations</b>&quot; in the 
&quot;<a href="pnl_system_e.htm#OPTIONS">OPTIONS&quot; page of the System Setting (SYSTEM SETTING) window</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>&nbsp;[14] <a name="Cant use the Learning function">Can't use the Learning 
function</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Has your host application stopped processing audio?</li>
</ul>
<p>If audio processing has been halted, it may not be possible to use the Learning 
function to specify a control change, since MIDI messages are not being sent 
to Orchestral. Refer to the owner's manual for your host application, and make 
sure that audio processing is enabled.</p>

Because of the reverence which die-hard Rhodes fans have for the original instruments and the brand itself, this short-lived keyboard has long been scorned as a digital &#34;wannabe&#34; instrument. &#10;&#10;What&#39;s less known is that the technology used in the MK-80 was actually the next generation of Structured Adaptive Synthesis pioneered in the legendary MKS-20 and its digital Rhodes sounds are excellent in their own way. They layer quite well with other Electric Piano sounds." >

 <ATTR  NAME="Description"  VALUE="In the 1980s, after the DX-7 craze, keyboard players were still searching for the &#34;Holy Grail&#34; Rhodes sound in digital form. In 1986, Roland unveiled the 16-voice MKS-20, the best-selling, rack version of their popular RD-1000. Both units used Roland&#39;s newly-developed &#34;Structured Adaptive Synthesis,&#34; an early type of re-synthesis that provided an extremely expressive response.&#10;&#10;Eric Persing worked on developing the famous MKS-20 sounds in Japan with Roland in the &#39;80s. Roland wisely combined the digital side of the instrument with high-quality analog components and effects, resulting in a far warmer sound than most keyboards of that time. The unit went on to be used on thousands of well-known productions and remains an enduring classic. This Soundsource uses the E. Piano 1 Patch." >

 <ATTR  NAME="Description"  VALUE="In the 1980s, the electric grand piano was king in live performance and in the studio. The sound was distinctive and it looked really cool on stage! But, they were pricey and the players who could afford one got tired of lugging around that 300 lb. beast! In 1986, Roland unveiled the 16-voice MKS-20 and its Electric Grand sound quickly earned its place on stage next to its analog cousin. In the same family as the CP70, it has its own unique sonic qualities.&#10;&#10;Eric Persing worked on developing the famous MKS-20 sounds in Japan with Roland in the &#39;80s.

 <ATTR  NAME="Description"  VALUE="Remember that incredible Rhodes sound from all those records in the Eighties? That elusive sound that, no matter how much EQ you dialed in or spent on mods, you could never get that same sparkle and punch? Well, we were fortunate enough to get our hands on this legendary custom 1974 Fender Rhodes (serial 54247-044074) and took the greatest care to reproduce its gorgeous mojo. &#10;&#10;The instrument&#39;s extraordinary sound comes from Eddy Reynolds, the legendary &#39;80s-era LA keyboard tech who performed his wizardry on this unique electric piano - one which was often rented and used on hundreds of famous albums. The combination of Eddy&#39;s magic touch, custom pre-amp design, and this particular standout Rhodes created a sonic masterpiece that is highly versatile, and extremely rare!" >

 <ATTR  NAME="Description"  VALUE="The Hohner Clavinet E was made from 1979 to 1984 and the Hohner Pianet T was made from 1977 to around the same time. Both were created by Hohner&#39;s visionary designer, Ernst Zacharias and each enjoyed its own popularity, but from 1978 to 1982, Hohner made a hybrid version that included both in the same enclosure. The keys simultaneously activated the Clavinet hammers and the Pianet sticky pads. The Clavinet action was underneath the Pianet, and this baby was heavy! It included the normal pickups for both.&#10;&#10;It was best to tune the Clavinet to the Pianet, as the Pianet rarely went out of tune. Both outputs were active at all times, and the fader controls adjusted the balance. The keyboard could be split between the two and the normal Clavinet pickup selectors were available as well. These instruments are quite rare." >

 <ATTR  NAME="Description"  VALUE="By the 1990s, the DX-7 Rhodes sound had run its course, but keyboard players still wanted an electric piano sound that had a cleaner, glossy sheen. Roland&#39;s JD-800 patch &#34;Crystal Rhodes&#34; was the answer. Like the D-50, it used Roland&#39;s 4-layer Sample+Synthesis method, but the architecture was much-improved and the sound was lush and vibrant. In fact, the JD-800&#39;s core waveforms and Factory presets were created by Eric Persing!&#10;&#10;The JD-800 had separate microprocessors for the synth section and keyboard scanning, and its playing response was as fast as CV synths - setting it apart from the overloaded processors of its contemporaries. To the JD-800&#39;s 4 oscillators, 4 filters, 8 LFOs and 12 envelopes, Roland added ultra high-quality effects and brought back an analog-style hardware panel." >

In 1986, Roland unveiled the 16-voice MKS-20, the best-selling, rack version of their popular RD-1000. Both units used Roland&#39;s newly-developed &#34;Structured Adaptive Synthesis,&#34; an early type of re-synthesis that provided an extremely expressive response.&#10;&#10;Eric Persing worked on developing the famous MKS-20 sounds in Japan with Roland in the &#39;80s. Roland wisely combined the digital side of the instrument with high-quality analog components and effects, resulting in a far warmer sound than most keyboards of that time. The unit went on to be used on thousands of well-known productions and remains an enduring classic. This Soundsource uses the E. Piano 1 Patch." >

Roland wisely combined the digital side of the instrument with high-quality analog components and effects, resulting in a far warmer sound than most keyboards of that time. The unit went on to be used on thousands of well-known productions and remains an enduring classic." >

 <ATTR  NAME="Description"  VALUE="Considered by many to be the &#34;gold standard&#34; of hybrid electro-acoustic pianos, the Yamaha CP-70 from the late 1970s has been heard on classic recordings for four decades. It has a powerful character that cuts through a mix. Noted users include Peter Gabriel, Genesis, Billy Joel, Stevie Wonder, UK, Kansas, Toto, and Led Zeppelin.&#10;&#10;No need to set up microphones, the CP-70 uses a piezo-electric pickup system, which is fed to its internal pre-amp. With real piano action, hammers, strings, and a removable damper pedal, it was made to withstand the rigors of touring and although it weighs 300lbs, it can be separated into two pieces. Its tuning is remarkably stable, even when moved. Yamaha also made two 88-key models - the CP-80 and the CP-60, a single-piece upright with MIDI." >

Since the mid-1960s, the Rhodes Electric Piano has been heard on practically every recording in almost every style of music, but these classic instruments were discontinued in the 1980s. Fast-forward to 2011 when Vintage Vibe released their new, hand-built &#34;Tine Piano.&#34; A high-quality, modern take on a classic with a vibey, authentic sound - the first &#34;real&#34; electric piano made from scratch in decades.&#10;&#10;It comes with American-made steel tines and rubber-tipped wooden hammers, along with either hand-wound passive pickups or Peterson-style pre-amps with stereo tremolo. The super-consistent action lets you play softly for a warm tone or lay into it for a real growl. We worked closely with Vintage Vibe to create the ultimate version of this modern-day classic!" >

 <ATTR  NAME="Description"  VALUE="Produced in the early 1960s, before the full-range Rhodes Electric Piano, the Piano Bass was the only Rhodes Piano (excluding the Pre-Piano) built before CBS bought both Fender and Rhodes in 1962. And, even though he helped develop the now-iconic, full-range Rhodes, Leo Fender disliked their sound and thought only the Piano Bass was marketable!&#10;&#10;Its piano action has rubber-tipped hammers that strike metal tines. The sound is sent to the passive output via electro-magnetic pickups. If you&#39;ve ever watched a 1960s vintage video of the Doors playing &#34;Light My Fire&#34; or &#34;Riders on the Storm,&#34; you probably noticed there was no bass player. Doors keyboardist Ray Manzarek played the Piano Bass perched on top of his Vox Continental organ." >

Since the mid-1960s, the Rhodes Electric Piano has been heard on practically every recording in almost every style of music, but these classic instruments were discontinued in the 1980s. Fast-forward to 2011 when Vintage Vibe released their new, hand-built &#34;Tine Piano.&#34; A high-quality, modern take on a classic with a vibey, authentic sound - the first &#34;real&#34; electric piano made from scratch in decades.&#10;&#10;It comes with American-made steel tines and rubber-tipped wooden hammers, along with either hand-wound passive pickups or Peterson-style pre-amps with stereo tremolo. The super-consistent action lets you play softly for a warm tone or lay into it for a real growl. We worked closely with Vintage Vibe to create the ultimate version of this modern-day classic!" >

Fast forward to 2011 when Vintage Vibe created the Tine Bass Piano - a quality, modern take on a classic.&#10;&#10;The Vintage Vibe Tine Bass is an electro-mechanical tine piano that weighs 37 pounds (much less than its inspiration). The pickups are routed through VV&#39;s own tube pre-amp. A tine piano lets you play softly for a warm tone or hit the keys hard for a real growl. Played as a bass by itself, doubled with a classic organ sound or even a real bass, this instrument adds a nice, fat low end to your track." >

Although the Claviset has a similar sound to the Hohner Pianet, the metal reeds are plucked by rotating rubber discs with small lips rather than being pulled by a sticky pads.&#10;&#10;The tines are amplified by electro-magnetic pickups routed to an internal battery-powered pre-amp. The instrument tone tabs on the front refer to the tonal qualities of the filters, rather than emulations of acoustic instruments. Difficult to get in the US until the Wall came down (and still rare to this date), the Claviset was famously used by Joe Meek and OMD (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark)." >

The &#34;Wurli&#34; was made from 1954 to the early 1980s and used metal reeds - small blades that were struck by the hammers of a real piano action. The 140B, released in 1962, was the first solid state model.&#10;&#10;Pickups routed the sound to a self-contained amplifier and speaker. The reeds are tuned by adding drops of solder to the tip and then filing it off until the pitch is right. In this highly-detailed model, we recorded the direct out and the internal speakers as well.

 <ATTR  NAME="Description"  VALUE="Many players say the iconic sound of the Wurlitzer 140B is absolutely the vibiest, the most soul-bending electric piano sound ever to rule the airwaves. The &#34;Wurli&#34; was made from 1954 to the early 1980s and used metal reeds - small blades that were struck by the hammers of a real piano action. The 140B, released in 1962, was the first solid state model.&#10;&#10;Pickups routed the sound to a self-contained amplifier and speaker. The reeds are tuned by adding drops of solder to the tip and then filing it off until the pitch is right. In this highly-detailed model, we recorded the direct out and the internal speakers as well. The first musician to record with an early 100 series Wurli was Sun Ra, for his 1956 &#34;Angels and Demons at Play&#34; and Ray Charles had a huge hit in 1959 with &#34;What&#39;d I Say,&#34; also using an early model." >

 <ATTR  NAME="Description"  VALUE="The iconic sound of the Wurlitzer Electric Piano has ruled the airwaves for over half a century. The &#34;Wurli&#34; was made from 1954 to the early 1980s. The 200A, updated from the 200, was released in 1974. The tone came from metal reeds - small blades that were struck by the hammers of a real piano action. Pickups routed the sound to a self-contained amplifier and speaker. It had a fixed-rate tremolo and an updated amp and speaker design. The reeds are tuned by adding drops of solder to the tip and filing it off until the pitch is right. &#10;&#10;Among the many artists who have famously used the 200A are Supertramp, Elton John, Pink Floyd, The Archies (&#34;Sugar Sugar&#34;), Joni Mitchell, and Steely Dan. We recorded both the direct signal and the speakers." >

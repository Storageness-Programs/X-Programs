1. Contents
    VSCO  2:  Community  Edition  contains  1,952
hand-picked   samples   from   the  21,500-sample
source library. This set is provided and designed
for the creation of personal sample libraries for
all purposes, both educational and commercial. It
can alternatively be used and manipulated into all
forms of pads, sections, and combined with exist-
ing freeware  libraries  to create new blends and
improvements.
    Update 1.1.0 adds an additional samples, brin-
ging the new total to 3,138 samples. Most of this
is made up of legacy samples from VSCO 1 and Upri-
ght No. 1, as well as a few additions from VSCO 2.
 
2. Terms
    You  are  permitted  to use these samples for
ANY purpose. We ask that you do not sell the sam-
ples directly, and encourage you to keep any work
done on improving the sample set open and public.

3. Sharing Branches

the source material or create your own port, you

than happy to host and distribute it for you, or

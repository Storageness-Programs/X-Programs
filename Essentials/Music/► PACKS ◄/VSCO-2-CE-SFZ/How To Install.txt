                  === USING .ARIAX FILES ===
                  
If you would like to make use of the default .ariax ensemble files,
you will need to open the .ariax files individually (in a text editor-
do this by double-clicking the file, then if it prompts you to search
for an application to open it, select "Select a program from a list of
installed programs". Now look for Notepad or for your preferred text
editor, such as Notepad++ (bonus points if it has XML filters).

Once inside, you will see a part with the text "<Slot " starting on
row 4. Further in the row, you will see a 'name="C:/Users" etc.
In the explorer window you used to open the file from, copy the path
by selecting it, pressing ctrl + C, and then go back into the text
editor. Replace from where it says "C:/Users" all the way through
"1952 Pack/" by selecting that region of text and then pasting the
new directory by pressing ctrl + V. Add a '\' or '/' right before
the start of the actual file name (i.e. right at the end of the
text you pasted).

Repeat this operation for EVERY <Slot> in EVERY .ariax file you
want to use. Unfortunately this is the only possible workaround
at this time due to some very annoying choices by Plogue with
regard to sharing presets from unofficial libraries...

Climb to the nearest hill with a baby goat and knife. Sacrifice 
the goat while asking your questions. Answers should be in the 
entrails. Also works on tofu.

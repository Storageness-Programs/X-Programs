Hey everyone! so here is the combinator patch for the 808 bass, I think it will only work in Reason 8 but feel free to try it in other versions. I also made long and short versions of the kicks playing a C and G note, so you should be able to just re-pitch them from there. Also I Included some of my music free for y'all.Feel free to use the samples in you any of your music. If you make something really cool with the samples I would to here it! so shoot me a message on Soundcloud or whatever. If you have any questions don’t hesitate to ask. Thanks! and hope you enjoy the samples.
